# ColumbiaMOWeatherTweetBot

Tweets weather forecasts twice daily for Columbia MO. Location can be changed in `config.json` for use in other cities. As a side note, I can't imagine why anyone would want this. Seeing as most people have a weather app on their smartphone that shows the weather on the lock screen. Why would anyone check twitter for the weather?

## Getting Started
You'll need api keys from Twitter and OpenWeatherMap which both come with signing up for a developer account.
+ [Register for an OpenWeatherMap developer account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
+ [Register for a Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply)

If you haven't installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) already, go ahead and do so.
After cloning the project, run `npm install` where `package.json` is which should be the root project directory.

## Deployment
Running `node index.js` will start up the bot.
Running `node `

## Contributing
A description with your pull request is fine.
Would be appreciated if it could be deployed as a linux service so it automatically starts on boot.
